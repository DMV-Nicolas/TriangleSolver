# TriangleSolver
This code developed by python3 detects from the given data which theorem to use (sine or cosine) and solves it, leaving the result in a text file with due process.

I did the code in my spare time to solve all the problems that the math teacher had, there were too many so I resorted to this, it may not be well optimized and the code looks a bit dirty, I invite you to improve it :)
